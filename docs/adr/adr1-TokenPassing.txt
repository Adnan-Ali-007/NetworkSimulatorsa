In a broadcast message forwarding, to prevent a broadcast storm, token passing is to be implemented.

Token Bus: In this type of token passing, a token is circulated around the network in a similar way to Token Ring.
However, instead of a predefined order, devices contend for the token when it becomes available.
When a device wants to transmit data, it waits for the token to become available, seizes it, and attaches its data to the token.
The token with the data then circulates around the network until it reaches the destination device, 
which removes the data from the token and releases it back into the network.

Token Bus, multiple tokens can be used, and each token circulates around a specific portion of the network. 
This allows for multiple devices to transmit data simultaneously on different portions of the network.

To implement token passing in a network, each device needs to be equipped with a token passing protocol that controls the transmission of data.
The protocol ensures that devices transmit data only when they hold the token and that they release the token when they have completed transmission. 
Token passing can be implemented in hardware or software, and it requires a certain level of coordination among devices to ensure proper operation.
