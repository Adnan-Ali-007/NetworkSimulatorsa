ADR-1: Use MVC architecture for project directory structure

Context: 
Implemented standard practices in software development industry as a learner. This was decided that, inorder to promote modularity in my TCP/IP application, MVC architecture will be used. 
It will allow creation of independent packages for the TCP/IP layers and devices therby applying layering within the TCP/IP model. 

Description:
- Model: contains classes responsible for managing the data and logic of your application. 
--   graph:
--   tcp/ip:
- View: contains classes responsible for presenting the data to the user through the user interface.
--   graph-rendering:
--   event-listners:
- Component: contains classes responsible for handling user input and updating the Model and View components accordingly.
--   graph-user-inputs:
--   network-flow:

Consequences:
Independent modules have been created and layering has been implemented.
